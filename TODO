THINGS TODO (mostly in order of importance)

* Let's unit test

* Optimize for IE (prettier than before, but slow like so many molasses)

* Limit the previous/next buttons to selectable months (between `earliest`
  and `latest`)

* Opera, please disable your text selection

* Elegant way to drag to months before and after the displayed calendars

* Internationalization
  
* Prettier initial styles, especially for non-Safari browsers
  - Just get the reset button generation out of there
  - Maybe do hidden inputs for the generated field defaults

* iPhone optimization

* Never too late for code CLEANUP and optimizations

* [?] Range options: minrange, maxrange, defaultrange (still thinking about
  this one)
