THINGS TODO (mostly in order of importance)

* Let's unit test

* Oh, and what about IE6? What a drag, huh?

* Elegant way to drag to months before and after the displayed calendars

* The Timeframe.prototype.date should also live-update with the field parsing

* Internationalization
  
* Prettier initial styles, especially for non-Safari browsers

* iPhone optimization

* Never too late for code cleanup and optimizations

* [?] Range options: minrange, maxrange, defaultrange (still thinking about
  this one)
