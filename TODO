THINGS TODO (mostly in order of importance)

* Let's unit test

* Oh, and what about IE6? What a drag, huh?

* Elegant way to drag to months before and after the displayed calendars

* Focus/blur for the endfield should bring the focus to the last calendar (not the first, as it stands now)

* The Timeframe.prototype.date should also live-update with the field parsing

* Internationalization

* Range options: minrange, maxrange, defaultrange
  
* Prettier initial styles, especially for non-Safari browsers

* iPhone optimization

* Never too late for code cleanup and optimizations
