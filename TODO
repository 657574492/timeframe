THINGS TODO (mostly in order of importance)

* Let's unit test

* Oh, and verify this works in all modern browsers
  - IE7
    - FIXME: clear button selector doesn't work

* Elegant way to drag to months before and after the displayed calendars

* Internationalization

* Range options: minrange, maxrange, defaultrange
  
* Prettier initial styles, especially for non-Safari browsers

* iPhone optimization

* Never too late for code cleanup and optimizations
