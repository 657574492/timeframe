THINGS TODO (mostly in order of importance)

* Let's unit test

* Oh, and verify this works in all modern browsers

* Internationalization

* Range options: minrange, maxrange, defaultrange
  
* Prettier initial styles, especially for non-Safari browsers

* iPhone optimization

* Never too late for code cleanup and optimizations
